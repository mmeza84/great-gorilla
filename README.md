# APE TIME (A.K.A. iDonate Joke Lottery v.2)
My dude used to do dinosaur jokes at the end of every standup.
They were fire.  Day in, day out.
The fact that man could come up with 5 jokes per week was downright admirable.
When he left, there was a void in the daily morning meeting.
I tried to keep the joke boat afloat, but after a few weeks, I was fresh out of jokes!
Something must be done.
I can't do it alone--but I work on a team...
The whole team seems to get a little dopamine drip from the one-liners...
What if the computer decides which team member tells the joke?
What if the computer -also- does other things on the way to that decision?
What if even within a rigid calculation, there was room for the human element?
This project reminds me why I love to press computer buttons.
